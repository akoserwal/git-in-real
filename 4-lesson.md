# Git-in-Real: Lesson 4

# Rebase: Rewriting history with a sequence of commits.

This is most common case while working with in a team.

You and your teammate started working on a same project/repository. You checkout a branch `Ch4-rebase` and your team mate `Ch4-feature` from same starting point. You both started working on adding some features. Now problem comes when we want to merge those changes back into the repository. If you merged your changes first. When your teammate try to merge back. He/she will get merge conflicts. 
Resolving conflicts are not very fancy part of this process. 

### Rebase comes to your rescue!!
